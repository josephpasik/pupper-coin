# PupperCoin Crowdsale

We will be conducting a crowdsale of our PupperCoin token in order to help fund the development of our canine genetics network. The network will be used to track the dog breeding activity across the globe in a decentralized way, and allow humans to track the genetic trail of their pets.

Once the Crowdsale has begun participants will have 24 weeks to purchase PupperCoin (PPC). We have set a goal of 1000 ETH.

1. Deploy the PupperCoinSale contract at: "0x7c201F7fd1E9f881028675A556e0a474A442FD80".
2. Enter your wallet address in the "Buy Tokens" function button.
3. Click "Buy Tokens" to purchase PupperCoin for ETH

The auction will end once the goal is met. If our goal is not met, your ETH will be refunded.

Thank you for your support!
